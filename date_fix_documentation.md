# Date Format Fix Documentation

## Issue
The SQLite database (`sieb.db`) had problematic date formats in the `valid_during` column of the `articles` table. The dates were in formats like "∞ until 09.11.2024 20:00:00" or "26.09.2024 00:00:00 until 31.12.2025 23:59:59", which caused errors when the system tried to cast them to timestamps:

```
Internal server error
java.lang.RuntimeException: io.wren.base.WrenException: Conversion Error: invalid timestamp field format: "∞ until 31", expected format is (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS[.US][±HH:MM| ZONE]) LINE 157: WHERE ((CAST(substring("articles"."valid_during", 1, 10) AS timestamp...
```

## Solution
We created a script to fix all problematic date formats in the `valid_during` column by replacing them with a standard ISO date format ('2025-12-31'). This ensures that the dates can be properly parsed by the system.

The fix was applied to 337 records in the `articles` table.

## Implementation
The fix was implemented using a bash script that runs SQLite commands to update the `valid_during` column. A backup of the database was created before making any changes.

## Verification
After applying the fix, we successfully queried the `articles` table and confirmed that the date formats have been standardized to '2025-12-31'.
